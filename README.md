# Image Generative Models

This repository has been created for the project MVA course 'Generative Models for Image', where the goal was to implement from scratch and compare Plug-and-Play (PnP) based and Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS from ...) algorithm under different degradation operators such as blurring, inpainting and subsampling. Here are some of the results : 

Quantitative and qualitative results for Gaussian deblurring with varying levels of noise
