# Image Generative Models

This repository was created for the MVA course project "Generative Models for Images". The objective was to implement from scratch and compare two algorithms - Plug-and-Play (PnP) and Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS)- under various degradation settings, including blurring, inpainting, and subsampling. Our experiments were conducted on the FFHQ-256 dataset.
